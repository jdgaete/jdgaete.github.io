This work involves a survey paper that focuses on the task of Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST). Particularly, we centered our efforts on direct, textless and multilingual S2ST. In contrast to conventional systems, these models do not rely on any intermediate text representations. Our goal is to present a detailed and exhaustive research of the breadth and the state of the art of S2ST systems. We start with a brief history and build up to the current state of the art along with the main datasets and evaluation metrics used in the field. We further identify the persisting challenges within the field and propose future directions for work accordingly.
