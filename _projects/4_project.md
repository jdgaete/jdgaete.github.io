In this project, we developed and enhanced a procedural walking simulator inspired by Minecraft. Our objectives included allowing block mining and crafting, gamifying the world, and introducing fractal trees into the landscape using L-systems. Furthermore, the walking simulator was produced featuring both CPU-based terrain generation and GPU-accelerated procedural texture synthesis utilizing Perlin noise. For the terrain, we employed multi-octave value noise to generate a 3x3 seamless chunk region around the initial player location.
