The management of group membership in fault-tolerant distributed systems is frequently a foundational element in the design of such distributed systems. Ensuring the correct behavior of the system necessitates consensus among all processes regarding the operational state of every processor. This research addresses this challenge by conducting a systematic and comprehensive study of membership protocols in both synchronous and asynchronous systems. Additionally, our work introduces a group communication model for hybrid systems. We conclude by outlining distinctions between the membership and consensus problems, where we explore their applicability to blockchains.
